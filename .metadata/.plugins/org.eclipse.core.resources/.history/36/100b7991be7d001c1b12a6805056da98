/**
 * Q2. Write a program that runs 5 threads, each thread randomizes a number
between 1 and 10. The main thread waits for all the others to finish, calculates
the sum of the numbers which were randomized and prints that sum. You will
need to implement a Runnable class that randomizes a number and store it in a
member field. When all the threads have done, your main program can go over
all the objects and check the stored values in each object.
